    <h2>Steps for making the recipes</h2>
    <h3>tep 1: The Crispy Onions (The "Ward")</h3>
    <p>This is the most important step because you will use the leftover oil for everything else.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Toss your thin onion slices with a bit of flour or cornstarch and a pinch of salt.</li>
        <li>In a large pan, heat the oil and fry the onions until they are deep golden brown (be careful not to burn them, or they will taste bitter).</li>
        <li>Remove them and let them drain on paper towels. They will get crispier as they cool. Save that oil!</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Step 2: The Rice and Lentils</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil the Lentils: Put the brown lentils in a pot with water and a bit of cumin. Boil for about 15–20 minutes until they are "half-cooked" (tender but still firm). Drain them.</li>
        <li>Toast the Vermicelli: In another pot, take 2–3 tablespoons of the onion oil and fry the vermicelli until it is golden brown.</li>
        <li>Combine: Add the washed rice to the vermicelli and stir. Add the half-cooked lentils.</li>
        <li>Cook: Add salt, cumin, and enough water to cover the mixture by about 2cm. Cook it just like regular rice (boil, then simmer on low heat until the water is absorbed).</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Step 3: The Pasta</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil the macaroni and spaghetti in salted water until al dente.</li>
        <li>Drain the pasta.</li>
        <li>The Secret Touch: While the pasta is still hot in the colander, toss it with 2 tablespoons of the onion oil. This prevents it from sticking and gives it the signature Koshari smell.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Step 4: The Red Sauce (Salsa)</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a saucepan, heat 2 tablespoons of the onion oil.</li>
        <li>Add the minced garlic and sauté until fragrant (don't let it brown).</li>
        <li>Add the vinegar—it will sizzle! Then quickly add the tomato puree.</li>
        <li>Add salt, pepper, cumin, dry coriander, and a pinch of sugar.</li>
        <li>Let it simmer on low heat for about 15–20 minutes until it thickens.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Step 5: The "Dakka" (Garlic Vinegar Sauce)</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl or jar, mix the crushed garlic, vinegar, lemon juice, cumin, and salt.</li>
        <li>Add about half a cup of warm water and stir well. (Some people like to give this a quick 1-minute boil on the stove, but raw is also great).</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Step 6: The "Shatta" (Chili Oil)</h3>
    <p><em>Warning: This will be very spicy!</em></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of the onion oil in a small pan.</li>
        <li>Add the chili powder and stir for 30 seconds (don't inhale the fumes!).</li>
        <li>Add a ladle of the prepared tomato sauce to it and stir. Remove from heat.</li>
    </ol>
